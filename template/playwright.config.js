/**
 * Playwright Configuration
 *
 * End-to-end test configuration for the Pochade-Electron template.
 *
 * For LLMs: Playwright tests simulate real user interactions in a
 * headless browser. They exercise the full stack: webpack bundling,
 * the dev server, custom elements, web workers, WebAssembly, OPFS
 * persistence, and (mocked) File System Access dialogs.
 *
 * The File System Access pickers are NATIVE dialogs — no automation
 * tool can click them. The e2e suite therefore stubs
 * window.showSaveFilePicker / window.showOpenFilePicker via
 * page.addInitScript() and asserts how our code drives the dialog
 * API (see tests/e2e/file-storage-component.spec.js).
 *
 * First run: npx playwright install chromium
